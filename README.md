# caesar-cipher
Caesar cipher (or Caesar code) is a shift cipher, one of the most easy and most famous encryption systems. It uses the substitution of a
letter by another one further in the alphabet.

How to encrypt using Caesar cipher:

Encryption with Caesar code is when a same letter is replaced with only one other. Caesar code is defined on an alphabet shift: a letter
further in the alphabet.

Plain Alphabet	ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ

Caesar Alphabet (+3)	DEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZABC

Another way to crypt, more mathematical, note A=0, B=1, ..., Z=25, and add a constant (the shift), then the result modulo 26 
(alphabet length) is the coded text.

How to decrypt Caesar cipher:

Caesar code decryption replaces a letter another with an inverse alphabet shift : a previous letter in the alphabet.

Another way to de crypt, more mathematical, note A=0, B=1, ..., Z=25, subtracts a constant (the shift), then the result modulo 
26 (alphabet length) is the plain text.
